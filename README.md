### Optional Stories

* [ ] Users can log in with Facebook.
* [ ] Users receive an email when they have purchased a ticket.
* [ ] Users can see "related events" when browsing an event. Related events should belong to the same category and be in the same region.
* [ ] User A can allow User B to edit User A's event. In other words, an event owner can assign other people to be "event admins". 
* [ ] Ticket types have an optional "minimum" purchase quantity. ([Example Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/DOYtAR0.png))
* [ ] Events are automatically labeled as "Hot". "Hot" events should have a red border or some sort of visual flourish. The event title should also be prefixed with "**HOT:**".
* [ ] Instead of showing all of the events on the main page, an "admin" user can dictate the events that show up on the main page.

## Notes
